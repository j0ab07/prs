# Pandemic Resilience System (PRS)

The **Pandemic Resilience System (PRS)** is a web-based platform designed to manage critical activities during pandemics, serving government officials, merchants, and the public. It supports supply chain management, vaccination tracking, and secure data handling with a focus on privacy, scalability, and role-based access control (RBAC). Built using Django, Django REST Framework, and SQLite, it includes a responsive frontend for user interaction.

## Features
- **PRS-Id Generation**: Assigns unique identifiers to individuals, linked to encrypted National Identifiers.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Enforces purchase limits and schedules for critical items (e.g., face masks, milk) based on date of birth.
- **Vaccination Tracking**: Manages vaccination records with JSON support (planned NoSQL integration).
- **Merchant Management**: Allows merchants to enroll, manage stock, and record sales while complying with restrictions.
- **Government Dashboard**: Enables officials to monitor supply chains, vaccination records, and audit access logs.
- **Public Dashboard**: Lets individuals view records, locate supplies, and upload vaccination data.
- **Security**: Uses JWT authentication, RBAC, and AES-256 encryption for sensitive data.
- **Scalability**: Features indexed tables and stateless RESTful APIs for large datasets.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Django 4.x, Django REST Framework, SQLite
- **Authentication**: Simple JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 (via `django-encrypted-model-fields`), PBKDF2 hashing
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)

   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/token/ \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "pass123"}'
   ```

## API Endpoints
The PRS API is available at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/` and requires JWT authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Key endpoints include:

| Endpoint                              | Method | Description                              | Role Access                     |

View detailed specifications in the Swagger UI at `/api/docs/` or in `prs_schema.json`.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Three roles are supported:
- **Public**: View/update own records, check item availability, record purchases, upload vaccination records.
- **Merchant**: Manage own merchant profile, update stock, record sales.
- **Government**: Full CRUD access to all entities, audit access logs.

RBAC is implemented via `RoleBasedPermission` in `views.py`, using `UserProfile` and `GovernmentOfficial` models.

| Entity                  | Public Access                     | Merchant Access                     | Government Access               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Individuals             | Create/Read/Update (own)          | None (indirect via API)             | Full CRUD                       |
| Merchants               | Read                              | Create/Read/Update (own)            | Full CRUD                       |
| Critical Items          | Read                              | Read                                | Full CRUD                       |
| Merchant Stock          | Read                              | Create/Read/Update (own)            | Full CRUD                       |
| Purchases               | Read/Create (own)                 | Create/Read/Update (own)            | Full CRUD                       |
| Vaccination Records     | Read/Create (own)                 | None                                | Full CRUD                       |
| Government Officials    | None                              | None                                | Full CRUD                       |
| Access Logs             | None                              | None                                | Read/Create                     |

## Database Schema
The SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`) includes tables defined in `models.py`:
- **individuals**: PRS-Ids, hashed national identifiers, DOB.
- **user_profiles**: Links users to individuals or merchants.
- **merchants**: Business details with hashed licenses.
- **critical_items**: Item restrictions (limits, allowed days).
- **merchant_stock**: Merchant inventory.
- **purchases**: Transaction logs with restriction checks.
- **vaccination_records**: Vaccination data with JSON support.
- **government_officials**: Official roles.
- **access_logs**: Government action audits.

Sensitive fields (`national_identifier`, `business_license`) use PBKDF2 hashing, with AES-256 encryption via `EncryptedCharField`.

## Security Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Via `rest_framework_simplejwt` with short-lived tokens.
- **Data Protection**:
  - PBKDF2 hashing for sensitive fields (`models.py`).
  - AES-256 encryption via `EncryptedCharField` (`fields.py`).
- **RBAC**: Enforced by `RoleBasedPermission` (`views.py`).
- **CORS**: Configured in `settings.py` (update `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for production).
- **HTTPS**: Assumed for production.
- **Auditing**: Government actions logged in `access_logs`.

## Frontend Dashboard
The frontend (`static/index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) is a single-page application with:
- **Login/Registration**: Forms for authentication and account creation.
- **Role-Based UI**: Displays tables/forms based on user role.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and media queries for mobile support.
- **API Integration**: JavaScript `fetch` for API interactions (e.g., `createIndividual`, `getPurchases`).

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- **NoSQL Integration**: Vaccination records use a JSON field; plan MongoDB migration for scalability.
- **PDF Uploads**: Unstructured data (e.g., PDF certificates) not implemented; plan a `vaccination_files` table.
- **Custom APIs**: `/api/v1/stock/nearby/` and `/api/v1/vaccination-records/bulk-upload/` not implemented.
- **Production Readiness**:
  - Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB instead of SQLite.
  - Secure `SECRET_KEY` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in environment variables.
  - Restrict CORS and disable `DEBUG` in `settings.py`.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests with `pytest`.
